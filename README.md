   1) Library to request document from Web
   2) Operate with Berts Models 

3 - Function to prepare our Dataset:

Only need pass URL, where join in the visible text separete for space.

## Using the OpenAI
1 - Put key generated on the OpenAI (https://github.com/WanderBernardo/ArtificialIntelligence_OpenAI)
